# 🌐 Network Monitoring

This section contains Home Assistant UI configurations related to
network performance, connectivity, and diagnostics.

The focus is on:
- Internet link quality
- Latency and jitter visibility
- Throughput trends over time
- Detecting congestion and ISP issues

All configurations are built using native HA cards and
`custom:apexcharts-card` where higher fidelity is required.
